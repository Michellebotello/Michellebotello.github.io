    <p> The year was 2016. At that time I was 11 years old during 4th grade. 
     I was spending time studying during class. 
     At some point, the teacher shows up which I don't remember if she announced properly before she asked my classmatesâ€™ food choice for the trip to Massachusetts.
     Most of our food choices are only sandwiches of any kind, so mine was a turkey sandwich.
     We were given a permission slip for our parents to sign in and we left for the day. 
     When I arrived home, I showed mom the permission slip was a packet and signed it right away before she went shopping and packed some snacks for me. 
     She insisted that I should stay in good shape and fed well through a long bus ride because Massachusetts is far below from New York which is nearly 3 hours.
     A few days passed, the morning began and I arrived at school.
     Everyone; teachers and students carrying their backpacks are waiting outside for the bus after parents dropped them off.
     It did not take long enough before the bus finally arrived. 
     We were ready to enjoy the ride. </p>

      the truth is out there
