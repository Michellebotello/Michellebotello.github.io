  <p> One thing that I liked about my trip was the food that we ordered early. We had our sandwiches along with servings. All of the servings is handmade in
    a traditional way. There was one time that we saw a middle-aged lady was making herself a pie and baked it in the chimney. Most of my classmates wanted to 
    taste the pie but they were denied (and we'll never know what kind of pie she was baking). I considered that moment as my favorite because I loved eating 
    frequently.
