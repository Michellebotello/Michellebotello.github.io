 <p> The last thing we did in our trip before we return to school in New York, we started wandering around in a museum. It wasn't a big building, just 
    a small one. This building looks more like a house than a museum because the interior design is warming. We looked around the "house" and we were 
    allowed to explore the rooms in two floors except the third one (we were forbidden). There's only two floors available and the third floor is for
    authorized people only. The house has a painting of the Native Americans in a landscape on the wall at the staircase. Also, the rooms that the house
    have are 2 bedrooms, a kithcen, a living room, 2 bathrooms, dinning room and a probably a dance area. Every doorway has a fence with a binder standing 
    on the fence with a decription on it. The ridicilous thing that I did was that I accidentally knocked out one of the binders by elbowing it without 
    realizing when I turned around once I finished looking at the furniture of the bedroom from the 2nd floor until this boy started accusing me and 
    walked away. He didn't rumored anything after that.
