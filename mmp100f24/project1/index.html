  <p> I was a thrilled child to explore my first field trip in <a href="page2.html">Massachusetts</a> during 4th grade at the time of my seasonal birth month. 
  I loved the enviroment being peaceful and I admire the adventures I had in my childhood. It's one of my favorite moments I have in my memory lane. At the beginning, 
  it took a long journey to get there by a 2-hour bus ride in the morning then taking naps of the day or eating snacks while watching a mini screen. The good thing 
  was the weather isn't even cold because it was sunny, so we were lucky to attend this trip at the right time. I enjoyed the view that I was looking through a bus 
  window, seeing how everyone in the city rises up. After that, I turned back to my seat to eat snacks and watching TV before I fell asleep. It was a gentle ride.
