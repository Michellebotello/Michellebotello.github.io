 <p> After lunch, we started doing activities where we had to gather and sit in a circle while pretend that we're objects from the a book. This elder man 
    is narrating the "whatever-it-was" story and told students if our turn is being called by an object from the book he mentions, we had to stand up, spin
    around and sit back to our spots. It was a fun game that made us laugh everytime we stand up and spin.
