    <p> When the ride is over, I was curious to see what does it feels like to be in Massachusetts. I find this place warm and peaceful because there were less
    people in the fields, no buldings or noises and there were farm animals at the barn in a long distance. We gathered in 3 seperate groups before we started
    hiking. I barely remember the entire group walk we had in our trip. While hiking, we were intoduced by fruit, plants (one that I remembered the mint ordor
    that wasn't a fond of) and agriculture. Everything is basically Native American heritage and culture that I learned in class.
